    "fullContent": "Hi, sorry for the late message BUT I us ran across our old messages and lust want to say THANK YOU so much. With your testing materials for the pharmacy technician test the first tome I scored 1389 out of 1400 only bcs I'm enrolled full time in a university and had to study for other things. Within 3 months I've studied your materials more & scores wav over the passing score of 1400, I was even 1500. Although, I couldn't attend your classes. so managed to pass. Thank you again, there aren't many people like you in this world who's willing to help others; well like US... lol I've passed your study guide down to one of my pharmacy technician trainees and hopefully she'll pass on the first time; so far she says she's understanding."
